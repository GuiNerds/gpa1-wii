Q1.  Isn't this game just a rip-off of Squaresoft's Final Fantasy 7?

A1.  It does have many similarities.  A lot of this is because Square and I
     had a similar program.  Creating a 3d-game when all your experience
     is with 2D games.  As with FF7, GPA1 is just an overhead 2d-RPG
     with some pretty 3d graphics tacked onto it.





Q.   I get semi-stuck in corners on the world map.  This sucks!

A.   Yes.  It's a limitation of the collision detection routines right now.
     I aim to fix this in the future.  For now just wiggle around till you
     are free.
