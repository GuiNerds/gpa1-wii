Installing
~~~~~~~~~~

You'll need SDL 1.2 installed.

On debian that means you will need to do
	apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev

Background
~~~~~~~~~~
A simple rpg adventure game engine that is fairly incomplete.

Originall written in the summer of 2001 while I was unemployed.
I was using it as an excuse to learn OpenGL using the RedBook and
my 3dfx banshee on a K6-2 machine.

You can see the ff7 influences (had just played through for the first
time) and can probably guess my favorite part of that game was always
flying the highwind around low over the ocean.
