BACKGROUND
~~~~~~~~~~

These texture files were all created by me, Vince Weaver, using The Gimp.

They are stored in my own custom "Paintpro" file format.  This file format
is unrelated to the commercial "PaintPro" program and is similar to the 
.pcx file format.  [For more info on my PaintPro format see 
http://www.deater.net/weave/vmwprod/paintpro.html]

Traditionally the extension for paintpro files is .ppp ["paint pro packed"] or
.pro.   Sometimes I just use the extension for the program the files belong
to [.tb1 for Tom Bombem images].

When I first invented the format I often used the ".amg" extension.
Officially this stands for the "AMazing Graphics" format, but in reality they
are the initials of a girl I liked at the time.  Still, .amg is a much
prettier extension than .ppp so I kept it for this project.


CREATING
~~~~~~~~

The included "paintpro.c" file is a plug-in for The Gimp 1.2.x
[http://www.gimp.org] to load and save files in this format.

To compile you need to download the Gimp 1.2.x sourcecode.  configure and
compile it as you normally would.  Then copy the paintpro.c file included
here into the root gimp source-code directory.  Change into the directory, and
do a "gimptool --build paintpro.c"  .  This should create a file called 
"paintpro" .  Copy this plugin to somewhere gimp will find it, such as
~/.gimp-1.2/plug-ins/

Now start up the gimp, and you should be able to load and save paintpro files.

Some notes:

   Theoretical Maximum resolution:   2048x2048x2048 colors
   Practical Maximum Use (tested):   1024x 768x 256 colors
   
When saving and loading you can just go by extension.  If you are choosing
file type it should either appear as PPP or AMG in the menu.

Before saving, make sure you "flatten" the image, and then convert it to 
"indexed" mode, otherwise you will get errors.
